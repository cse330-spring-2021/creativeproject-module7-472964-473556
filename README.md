# COVID-19 & Mental Health Portal 
## Project Description
Users can create an account to keep track of their mental health and COVID-19 symptoms by taking a daily survey. Their data is tracked and plotted for each time they complete the survey. Users are given their score upon completing the survey based on their input. Additionally, users are given suggestions based on their input for how they can improve.



## Creative Portion
Users are given a daily quote which updates upon completion of the survey. This quote is retrieved using an inspirational quote API. Users can change the color scheme of their charts upon clicking the button of their preferred color scheme. Users can interact with the data displayed on their charts by hovering over data point, bars, or pie slices; users are shown the specific numbers corresponding to the data when hovering. Each time a user submits a form, a score is calculated based on their input data and displayed.
